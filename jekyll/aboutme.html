<p class='about-text'>
    <span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
    I started my career at <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Anafocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Anafocus</b></a>, 
    designing tests, and automating measurements for ASIC devices and image sensors characterization. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After the company was acquired by <a href="https://imaging.teledyne-e2v.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Teledyne</b></a>, 
    I relocated to their sites in France and China where I focused on camera middleware, system development, and customer support.
    <br>
    <br>
    Today, as Application Engineer I manage technical support, product development, and client relationships. 
    My role includes coding proof-of-concepts for presales, developing APIs and SDKs, and implementing CI and CD techniques to ensure smooth and reliable integration for our customers. 
    I also train the sales team to help them effectively present our solutions.

    <span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
    I graduated in <a href="https://etsi.us.es/estudios-y-titulaciones/grados/grado-en-ingenieria-de-las-tecnologias-de-telecomunicacion/plan-de-estudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Telecommunications Engineering</b></a> at the University of Seville, 
    where I balanced my studies with competitive rowing. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After deciding to focus on my career, I applied to the semiconductor industry filling the space that competitive sport had left in my life and completing my degree. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Later, I completed a Master in <a href="https://www.masterseeiuma.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Electronics and Embedded Systems</b></a> at the University of Malaga, which deepened my understanding of embedded systems and low-level programming. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This motivated me into software roles, leading me to a second Master in <a href="https://www.codeurjc.es/mastercloudapps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Cloud Native Applications Development</b></a> at the University Rey Juan Carlos where I specialized in cloud computing, microservices, and DevOps practices.
